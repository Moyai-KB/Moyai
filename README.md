## What is this?
**This is a design suite for Fusion360, attempting to make the "stem" part of the popular MX-style 3d-printable using MSLA printers.**

Requirements: 
- An MSLA printer.
- Average experience with printing in resin.
- Patience to figure out the proper dimensions to achieve the needed tolerances for *your* printer.
- Autodesk Fusion 360.

### Why?
**Good tactile switches are expensive. Let's try changing that.**

The pre-configured stem was designed to be printed on the Elegoo Mars 2 Pro using Anycubic Basic Translucent Green resin. The reference model was the stem from a Kailh Pro Purple switch, which already supplies some tactility. But we want more! So let's add more.

### Features
- Fully parametric design.
- Designed for SLA printing in mind.
- Nice, mid-heavy tactile bump.
- Really cheap to print.

### Future Plans
Yes, this stem isn't silky smooth like good injection molded ones. *yet*.

The future plans are to:
- Make a Moyai-BOX stem [ Planned ]
- Make Moyai compatible with more switches. Look at my ko-fi to support this! [ WIP ]
- Organize a GroupBuy [ WIP ]

If you are a keyboard shop capable of 3d printing Moyai and wish to sell prints of the design, please do not hesitate to contact me so a commercial agreement can be made!


### Compatibility
**Compatible housings tested so far:**
- Kailh Pro
